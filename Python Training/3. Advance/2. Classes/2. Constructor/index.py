# 2. __init__ is a constructor which allow us to create variables in class.

"""In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class
is created. The constructor method is defined using the __init__ method.
It allows you to initialize the object's attributes with specific values when the object is created.
"""

"""The primary use of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of a class when an object is created. 
This ensures that the object is in a valid state right from the start."""

# From FreeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-attributes-class-and-instance-attribute-examples/
""" Class attributes remain the same for every object and are defined outside the __init__() function. 
Instance attributes are somewhat dynamic because they can have different values in each object."""
# From InterviewBit
""" __init__ is a constructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. 
All classes have a __init__ method associated with them. It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class 
from local variables."""

# Self Parameter
"""The self-parameter refers to the current instance of the class and accesses the class variables. We can use anything 
instead of self, but it must be the first parameter of any function which belongs to the class."""

""" When we do not include the constructor(_init_) in the class or forget to declare it, then that becomes the default constructor.
 It does not perform any task but initializes the objects."""

# More than One Constructor in Single class
""" What happen if we declare the two same constructors in the class. the object of the class will always call the last 
constructor if the class has multiple constructors."""
